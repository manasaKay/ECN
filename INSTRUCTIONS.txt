* Download the link in google drive and unzip the folder.
* In the terminal, change directory to ECN.
* Make sure to check that checkpoint_m_to_d.pth.tar and checkpoint_d_to_m.pth.tar are stored in the logs folder.
* In terminal, type  >> sh run.sh

Explanation of what happens in run.sh:
1) The script first creates the duke, market and star_gan datasets - this step will run for a couple of hours.

2) For source as Duke and target as Market, the script loads the best model weights from the logs folder. 
    * The query images as well as the top 5 images predicted by the model as closest to each corresponding query image are stored in the folder "results_market_to_duke". The format in which it is stored in given below.
q_1.jpg --> r_1_1.jpg, r_1_2.jpg, r_1_3.jpg, r_1_4.jpg, r_1_5.jpg
q_2.jpg --> r_2_1.jpg, r_2_2.jpg, r_2_3.jpg, r_2_4.jpg, r_2_5.jpg
and so on until
q_10.jpg --> r_10_1.jpg, r_10_2.jpg, r_10_3.jpg, r_10_4.jpg, r_10_5.jpg
    * Also, the reported CMC and mAP scores are displayed in the terminal.

3) Same way, for source as Market and target as Duke, the script loads the best model weights and considers 10 query images from the target and obtains the 5 closest images to it. These images are stored in the same format as above, in the folder "results_duke_to_market". Also, the reported CMC and mAP scores are displayed in the terminal.
